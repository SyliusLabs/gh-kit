# ðŸš§ GitHub Kit for Sylius
A powerful Golang-based replacement for hubkit. It's a command line tool that helps you to manage your GitHub repositories.

Keep in mind that this is a work in progress, and it's not a full replacement for hubkit yet.

## Installation
1. Install GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/)
2. Run `gh auth login` and follow the instructions
3. Run `gh extension install SyliusLabs/gh-kit`

Now you can use `gh kit <command>`.
